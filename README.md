# JiggleBonesSharp
A Godot 4 addon inspired by [jigglebones](https://github.com/yaelatletl/godot-jigglebones), remade in C#.

## Improvements
- C# bindings
- Better performance
- Min/max degrees constraints
- Replaced deprecated bone pose overrides with new `SkeletonModifier3D` (inspired by [wigglebones](https://github.com/HappyHeads/godot-wigglebones))
